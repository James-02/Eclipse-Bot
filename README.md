Firstly:
- Open the config.json file in the 'Files' folder, and fill in the first section.
- The first part is all section of 3 lines, these must be filled in correctly, 
- The middle section is optional but must be filled in to use the associated commands.
- The final section should not be filled in, the bot will do that itself.

- If you need help filling in the config.json or have any troubles, please message Jam#0191 on discord or make a ticket in https://discord.gg/N6xA3JZ

To get the bot into your discord: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW8c7vT6Hl4

- Log into discord developer portal: https://discordapp.com/developers and create a new application
- Go to "Bot" on the side and click "add a bot" name it whatever you want it to be called and add a profile picture.
- Under "Token" you will see click to reveal and copy. You will need to copy and paste that token into the config.json file.
- Go To 0Auth2 on the side, select "bot" in the scopes section and copy the link and paste it into the browser, then select your server and the bot will join.
- To turn the bot online you will still need to put the token into config.json and run the bot, you will need python and the modules installed to run the bot if you are running the bot regularly.

If you have any issues please message Jam#0191 on discord.
