# To Invite The Bot To Your Server

- Log into discord developer portal: https://discordapp.com/developers and create a new application
- Go to "Bot" on the side and click "add a bot" name it whatever you want it to be called and add a profile picture.
- Under "Token" you will see click to reveal and copy. You will need to copy and paste that token into the config.json file.
- Go To 0Auth2 on the side, select "bot" in the scopes section and copy the link and paste it into the browser, then select your server and the bot will join.
